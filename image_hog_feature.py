    cv2 (OpenCV): Used for video capture, image processing, and display.

    numpy: Provides support for numerical operations on arrays.

    skimage.feature: Provides the hog() function for extracting Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) features.

    skimage.exposure: Used to rescale the intensity of images for better visualization.

#%% Open CV Video Capture and frame analysis
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
'''
    Opens the default webcam (0).

    Alternative: If using an external camera, change 0 to 1 or the respective camera index.
'''

# Check if the webcam is opened correctly
if not cap.isOpened():
    raise IOError("Cannot open webcam")
'''
    Ensures the webcam is successfully opened.

    If it fails, an I/O error is raised.

            feature.hog() extracts HoG features.

            HoG Parameters Explained:

                orientations=9: Uses 9 orientation bins for gradient computation.

                pixels_per_cell=(8, 8): Divides the image into 8Ã—8 pixel cells.

                cells_per_block=(2, 2): Normalizes features over 2Ã—2 block of cells.

                transform_sqrt=True: Applies square-root transformation for normalization.

                block_norm="L1": Uses L1 normalization to scale feature vectors.

                visualize=True: Returns the HoG image representation (hogImage).

                
            Lower orientations (e.g., from orientation=9 to 6) â†’ Less detail, smoother features
            Higher orientations (e.g., from orientation=9 to 18) â†’ More detailed features, but noisier image

            Larger pixels_per_cell (e.g., from pixels_per_cell=(8, 8) to (16, 16)) â†’ Larger blocks, less fine details
            Smaller pixels_per_cell (e.g., from pixels_per_cell=(8, 8) to (4, 4)) â†’ Finer details but more computation

            Larger blocks (e.g., from pixels_per_cell=(2, 2) to (3,3)) â†’ More generalized features, smoother detection
            Smaller blocks (e.g., from pixels_per_cell=(2, 2) to (1,1)) â†’ Very local features, might introduce noise

            Change block_norm="L1"

                Options:
                    "L1" : L1 normalization
                    "L2-Hys" : More robust against lighting changes
                    "L2" : Normalization with better contrast preservation

                ðŸ”Ž Effect:
                    "L2-Hys" usually gives better feature representation for object detection.
                    "L1" might make subtle features more visible.

            Change transform_sqrt=False
                Options:
                    True: Helps with illumination changes (better contrast).
                    False: Can result in darker feature maps.
