   - Give a unique name for your RPi hostname.
   - Pick an appropriate username and password
   - Configure the WiFi to your hotspot (SIT WiFi doesnt work well with RPi)
   - Also enable SSH in the services tab (to SSH to Pi later)
   - Click on "Save"
   - Click on "Yes" and "Yes" again.

#### Section 2: Configuring Raspberry Pi
1. **Assembling Hardware**:

2. **Enabling VNC**:
- Connect to RPi 400 via SSH (e.g. use Putty).
- You can find the RPi400's IP via your mobile hotspot or router.
   - Alternatively, you may use the following: `raspberrypi.local` (assuming you named your device as raspberrypi)
- [Optional] If you are using a Rasperry PI without keyboard, you need to enable VNC option without keyboard by the below command
  ```
  sudo apt install haveged
  ```
- Enable the VNC using the following command and selecting "Interfacing Options", navigate to "VNC", choose "Yes", select "Ok" and select "Finish".
  ```
  sudo raspi-config
  ```

3. **Setting Up a Static IP (Optional)**:
   - For easier connection, assign a static IP to your RPi 400.
   - Open Terminal and edit the `dhcpcd.conf` file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
     ```
   - Add the following lines at the end of the file (replace with your network details):
     ```
     interface eth0
     static ip_address=192.168.x.xxx/24
     static routers=192.168.x.x
     static domain_name_servers=192.168.x.x
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor (CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter).
   - Reboot the RPi 400.

4. **Installing VNC Viewer on Your Laptop**:
   - Download and install VNC Viewer on your laptop from the official [VNC Viewer website](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).

5. **Connecting to the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Open VNC Viewer on your laptop.
   - Enter the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (same IP address as used with SSH) and press Enter.
   - When prompted, enter the Raspberry Pi's username and password.

6. **Using Raspberry Pi Desktop Remotely**:
   - Once connected, you should see the Raspberry Pi's desktop interface on your laptop.
   - You can now use the Raspberry Pi as if you were working directly on it.

7. **Update the RPi 400 System**:
   - Open Terminal.
   - Update the system with the following commands:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```

#### Section 3: Setting Up and Testing the Webcam

1. **Connecting the Webcam**:
   - Plug the webcam into a USB port on the RPi 400.
   - The drivers for the webcam should be automatically installed.
     ```
     lsusb
     ```

2. **Install Software to capture image**:
   - Ensure that you have internet access.
   - Install 'fswebcam' for capturing images:
     ```
     sudo apt install fswebcam
     ```

3. **Capture Image with Webcam**:
   - Use `fswebcam` to capture an image:
     ```
     fswebcam -r 1280x720 --no-banner image.jpg
     ```

4. **View and Edit Images (Optional)**:
   - Install an image editor like GIMP:
     ```
     sudo apt install gimp
     ```
   - Open the captured image in GIMP for editing.

5. **Recording Video**:
   - Install `ffmpeg` to record video from the webcam:
     ```
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     ```
   - Record a video from the webcam:
     ```
     ffmpeg -f v4l2 -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 output.mp4
     ```
   - this command tells ffmpeg to capture video from the first connected webcam at a resolution of 640x480 pixels and a frame rate of 25 fps, and save it to a file named output.mp4. In addition, "-f" specifies the format to be used while "v4l2" stands for Video4Linux2, which is the standard video driver model for Linux for video capture.

6. **Play Video (Optional)**:
   - Install VLC media player:
     ```
     sudo apt install vlc
     ```
   - Play the recorded video using VLC:
     ```
     vlc output.mp4
     ```

7. **Checking for Audio Device**:
   - First, check if your system has recognized the webcam's microphone.
   - Open Terminal and type the following command to list all audio input devices:
     ```
     arecord -l
     ```
   - Look for your webcam in the list. The following image shows what you might see.
![arecord](https://github.com/drfuzzi/INF2009_Setup/assets/108112390/ce795948-b92a-4486-a933-eab2fe27b0b5)

8. **Use the arecord Command**:
   - To test if the microphone is working, record a short audio clip:
     ```
     arecord -D plughw:<CardNumber>,<DeviceNumber> -d 10 test.wav
     ```
   - Replace `<CardNumber>` and `<DeviceNumber>` with the numbers you found in the previous step. The `-d 10` flag tells `arecord` to record for 10 seconds.
   - Based on the above screenshot, the USB audio device is listed as `card 2, device 0`, I specify these in the command.
   - To record a short audio clip, use the following command in the terminal:
     ```
     arecord -D plughw:2,0 -d 10 test.wav
     ```
   - Here's what each part of the command means:
     - `arecord`: This is the command to start recording audio.
     - `-D plughw:2,0`: The `-D` option specifies the audio device. `plughw:2,0` refers to `card 2, device 0`, which is your USB audio device.
     - `-d 10`: This option specifies the duration of the recording. `-d 10` means the recording will last for 10 seconds.
     - `test.wav`: This is the name of the file where the audio will be saved. It will be saved in the current directory.

9. **Playing the Recorded Audio**:
   - Play the recorded audio to check the quality:
     ```
     aplay test.wav
     ```
   - If you donâ€™t hear anything, adjust the microphone levels using the sound settings or `alsamixer` in the terminal.

#### Section 4: Advanced Applications (Optional)

a. Setting up and using a Virtual Environment
Using a Python virtual environment allows you to manage Python packages independently of the system packages. This is a recommended approach to avoid conflicts between packages installed via `apt` and `pip`.

1. **Install Virtual Environment Package**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment and run:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Packages Using pip**:
   Now you can install packages using pip without encountering the `externally-managed-environment` error:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

5. **Upgrade pip**:
   Ensure you are using the latest version of pip:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
Remember, after using the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply running `deactivate` in your terminal. Using virtual environments is a good practice as it keeps your global Python environment clean and prevents version conflicts between different Python projects.

b. **Python Scripting for Webcam**:
   - Introduction to using Python for controlling the webcam.
   - [Here](adv/capimg.py) is a simple script to capture a single video frame from the webcam and save it.

c. **Mock Exercise - Creating a Surveillance System**:
   - Setting up motion detection using the webcam.
   - [Here](adv/capvid.py) is another simple script to stream a video from the webcam and notify on screen if you detect motion using simple algorithm.

#### Section 5: Questions to think about

1. Identify and explain the additional functionalities introduced in Code #2. How do these changes transform the program from a simple image capture to a movement detection system?
2. Several new OpenCV functions are used (like cv2.absdiff, cv2.cvtColor, cv2.GaussianBlur, cv2.threshold, cv2.dilate, and cv2.findContours). Research each of these functions and understand their role in processing the video frames for movement detection.
3. The program uses specific conditions (such as contour area) to decide when to draw rectangles and indicate movement. Experiment with these parameters to see how they affect the accuracy and sensitivity of movement detection.
4. Loop Mechanics and Video Processing: Analyze the role of the while loop in the 2nd Code for continuous video capture and processing. How does this looping mechanism differ from the single capture approach in the 1st Code, especially in terms of real-time processing and movement detection?
5.  Consider aspects like improving the accuracy of movement detection, optimizing performance, or adding new features (like recording video when movement is detected).
